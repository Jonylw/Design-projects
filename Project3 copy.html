                <h2 class="mb-5">Instruction manual refleciton</h2>

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> Before starting the project, I first started by developing a reflection on the manual for the tracking car DIY kit. Upon reading the instruction manual, various challenges came to mind when constructing the Tracking Car DIY kit. 

                   </p> 
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> The first issue I feel will arise is with the photosensitivity sensors. They detect whether the car is driving on a white or black object, and how these sensors are soldered on can affect the car's driving ability. Also, this sensor signals to the motor to slow down, allowing the car to change direction. If the motor is not soldered on correctly in the example, if the copper wires are incorrectly attached to the printed circuit board(PCB) the motors will not have the proper power to drive the car correctly. 
 
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Another problem is the user-based skill issue when it comes to soldering parts onto the PCB. Those with more experience may have no trouble, but as someone who has never soldered before, I think the possibility for an incorrect solder is quite likely, as holding the iron onto the board for too long will cause damage to the components of the kit. 
 
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">When reading through the pictures for installation, one difficult aspect that stuck out was the parts that act as dipoles (positive and negative charges). Examples of the parts are the LED and the Electrolytic capacitor. Improper soldering of these parts can lead to lack of functionality in those pieces of the kit.  
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Achieving an accurate height for the photoresistors seems to be another challenging aspect to the kit. Incorrect installation of the resistors can cause problems as the degree of resistance output is dependent on the amount of light and if they are too high or too low, it will cause improper signals to be sent to the PCB.
 
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">As I looked at the visual image of the finished kit towards the end of the manual, I noticed the close proximity of all the parts on the PCB. This can be problematic as having to closely solder these pieces it can result in an unwanted solder bridge. 
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                       <h2 class="mb-5">Strengths of the manual</h2>  
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">1)  The manual provides a very detailed description of what the steps are to build the kit. The instructions are very clear and brief, which made assembly much easier for a beginner like myself. To assist in making the building of the kit easier, the installation tips section in the manual was very insightful. It provided tips on proper preparation for construction along with installation tips such as directionality to ensure proper function of the kit.

                  <br> <br> <br> 

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">2)  I found the install shown steps(XI) to be very helpful. This section of the manual provided step-by-step visual examples as to how installation is to be completed. These photos were close up and had high-quality resolution, so it was much easier to refer to than the installation steps with no photos.
                  <br> <br> <br> 

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">3)  To add to this point, although I preferred the steps with photos, the steps listed in the above section (VIII) did not skip steps. Essentially, what I mean by that is each piece of the kit had its own installation step as opposed to the manual putting multiple parts together into one step, making it more difficult to follow.
                <br> <br> <br>
                <h2 class="mb-5">Weaknesses/ changes </h2> 
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">To begin with, weaknesses of the manual, the complexity level for assembly is one challenge I faced. As someone who has never soldered before, the multitude of steps and the complexity of each one made the instructions a bit hard to follow. 

                  <br> <br> <br> 

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">I would change the manual by elaborating a bit more on some of the more intricate steps, such as soldering on the motors. If they could break up the larger steps into smaller, simpler ones, especially for the important components, it would make assembly much easier.

                  <br> <br> <br> 

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Another weakness is the minimal instruction for further modification of the kit. I understand that it is for beginners, but I felt like there wasnâ€™t any information on how to customize the car for more advanced modifications.

                  <br> <br> <br> 

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">To change this weakness, I would add a link into the manual towards the end that redirects users to instructions for customization. The link would include info on how to modify the car so it can optimize performance in areas such as speed, more responsive sensors, etc.  

                  <br> <br> <br> 
                  <h2 class="mb-5">Part 1: Robot Assembly </h2> 

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">After critiquing the DIY manual, my partner and I decided that we would both work together on building one car in case anything went wrong, so we would essentially have a backup. 
                  <br> <br> <br> 
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Importantly, before we started soldering the actual kit we practiced on a separate board to make sure we had the technique down. What I found to be extremely useful was a YouTube video on how to Solde,r which recommended holding the soldering iron to the board for about 3 seconds before releasing. Not only did this allow the solder to get to the perfect temperature, but it also ensured that we did not fry the electronics on the board.
                  <br> <br> <br>  <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 1: To begin constructing the car, we started by installing the 4 metal film resistances at positions (R5, R6, R11, and R12). 

                  <br>  <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 2: The 2 metal film resistors were placed and soldered onto positions R9 and R10.
                  <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 3: 2x 1k metal film resistors set in place at R7 and R8. 
                  <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 4: DIP-8 IC socket was placed in its respective position.
                  <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 5: (2x) Transistors installed at Q1 and Q2. 
                  <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 7: (2x) Red LEDs are installed at D1 and D2. For this step it was crucial to have the pins in their proper position according to their charge (positive or negative) to ensure proper operation.
                    <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 8: (2x) potentiometers installed at R1 and R2. 
                        <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 9: (2x) Electrolytic Capacitors installed at C1 and C2. At this point in the installation process, soldering without creating bridges was becoming increasingly difficult as the pieces were getting closer together in terms of installation. To combat this issue, we enacted a method of bending the wires in opposite directions to provide more surface area for proper soldering. 
                            <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 10: Self locking switch(button) installed at S1.
                                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 11: (2x) Photoresistors installed at R13 and R14 on the bottom of the printed circuit board(PCB). To ensure a proper height of 5mm for the resistors, we utilized the digital caliper measurement tool to get a close approximation. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 12: (2x) white LEDs installed at D4 and D5, a caliper was again used to measure a height of around 14mm for the lights. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 13: Support screw, nut, and cap installed at the forefront of the board. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 14: (4x) yellow gaskets and screws fastend onto the PCB. This was another area of struggle for us as the gaskets were extremely hard to get on. We eventually figured out a method that worked best which involved pliers to screw on the gaskets properly. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Steps 15-21: The wheels for the car were assembled. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 22: (2x) DC motors installed in positions M1 and M2 and secured with 4 motor screws. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 23: (2x) worms installed on motor shaft.
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 25: Wheel alignment onto the yellow gaskets. This step became a bit complicated as a soldering error caused problems after the car was completed. When soldering, my partner accidentally touched the iron to the wheel of the car, causing it to melt. This resulted in improper function of the gear as it was unable to complete a full circular cycle due to the melted section. To resolve this problem, we took the gear from our other kit, replacing it with the old one, and the car then began to function as normal.
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 26: (2x) motors were connected through (4x) cables onto the PCB. We paid close attention to the coloration of the wires we connected as the manual warned of improper installation causing abnormal function. 
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 27: Battery case was installed centrally to the kit.
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 29: DIP-8 LM393 was installed at IC socket.
                <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Step 30: (2x) Batteries were inserted to the battery pack and the kit was turned on. 
                 <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">After the car was successfully assembled, we used the caliper to take measurements of the car and recorded them in a table to assist us in the next step of the process, which was designing a chassis for the kit in Autodesk Fusion.

                <h2 class="mb-5">Kit reflection</h2> 

                  <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Our car worked very well and I feel as though a lot of that is attributed to the careful installation approach that my partner and I took. Not only did we read through the instructions thoroughly, but we also made sure to take our time on each step, not rushingto prevent errors in the long run.

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif;">The schematic for the car took into account the key features that the chassis must have. To allow the wheels to move freely, I cut out a wheel well for the back tire of the kit. I measured the diameter of the wheel itself to ensure a proper fit. Another required feature was for the sensors to be able to see the ground, so we kept the bottom of the chassis open so that it wouldnâ€™t cause any obstruction. The third feature is to be able to see the LEDs, which are visible from the top-down view, also through the front windows of the chassis. The fourth and fifth features are to be able to change the batteries and press the power, which are also accessible through the roof.

                        <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif;">Before building the chassis for the kit, I took measurements of the car using the caliper so that I would have a guideline as to what the dimensions of the chassis needed to be so that it would fit onto the car properly.

                    <h2 class="mb-5"style="margin-right: -850px;">Autodesk Fusion first iteration</h2>
                     <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif;"> At this point in the project, my partner and I began the design process for the chassis. I shared the Autodesk Fusion project with him so that we could collaborate on the design. Our strategy for dividing the work of the design was as sort of back and forth where one person would state ideas and the other would make those changes in Fusion and then we switched after some time. This strategy not only prevented one person from having to do all of the work, but also allowed us to brainstorm in an efficient way as the person not actively designing was coming up with ideas to improve our first iteration.
</p>  
                     <br> 
                        <img class="center" src="assets/Fusionfirst.JPEG" style="width:550px;height:300px;transform:translate(575px,0px)"/>

                       <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">The first iteration served the sole purpose of getting the proper fit for the car. There wasn't too much aesthetdesignign that whwe went en into this we just wanted to make sure that our final chassis would have the proper fit and this print served as the foundation. To cut out the wheel well I used the hole feature and made the diameter slight wider thant the wheels and extruded the cylinder through both sides of the design. 

</p> 

                         <br> <br><br><br>  <br> <br>
                          <img class="center" src="assets/PrusaFirst.JPEG" style="width:550px;height:300px;transform:translate(575px,0px)"/>
                            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> After finishing the design in Fusion, the file was exported as a STL and then imported into Prusa slicer to prepare the design for the printing process. The design had good stability except for the open areas of the wheel well, so to ensure a successful print I used the paint on support to provide extra strength in those areas. I also used raft layers on the bottom of the design as the width of the walls that made contact with the board of the printer were a bit thin. The process of exporting the file from Fusion into Prusa slicer was copied for all three iterations of the design.</p>

                              <h2 class="mb-5"style="margin-right: -850px;">Second iteration</h2>

I added side and rear windows again first by using the create a sketch feature to draw out the shapes I wanted for the design. I then extruded the finished sketches through the design for the sideview mirrors. Also, to make the design of the chassis more fluid, I used the fillet tool under the modify tab to round the edges of the chassis. The second interaction was a step closer in the direction of where we wanted to go for our final design, but we wanted to develop something innovative that did two things, reduce the weight of the chassis to allow the car to move freely, and two increase the durability of the chassis as the second print came out thinner than expected. To fix the lacking durability of the design, we added extra supports to the final version of the car using the paint on supports too, which allowed us to apply support in areas that were specifically needed.

The model was styled after a UPS truck and it started simply just as a box that fit the dimensions of our KIT. The extrusion function was used in various aspects of the design: the doors, windows, roof, and backdoor. We added the back door to make the switch more accessible, and also made the front windows larger so that the LEDs could be seen. The diameter of the wheel well was kept the same to ensure an accurate fit. The final design ended up fitting perfectly on the car and allowed for full functionality of the wheels.

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">  This process was by no means linear, but instead a development of trial and error. Although going through various iterations took a lot of time, what I came to realize in the end was that it made me extremely comfortable using Autodesk Fusion. Tools I used to have to look up became second nature and this was visible as each version showed momentous improvements from a design standpoint. The final design allows access to all five key features: the wheels can move, the sensors can see the ground, the LED's are visable, the batteries are changeable, and the button can be pressed. I would say overall part 2 of the project went very well and I enjoyed the process of seeing what was at one point only a sketch, progress into a polished product. </p>

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif">To start the process of designing a laser cut chassis, my partner and I started by taking the measurements from the 3D printed design to use for the laser cut. <br><br> We opened up a new project space in Fusion and started to craft the design. We followed the YouTube tutorial for how to make a finger joint box for laser cutting in Fusion 360.

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif">The first step of the process was to set the user parameters for the box. These parameters served as a standardization for what we wanted the box to look like. They are also adjustable, which allows the user to get a better fit for the DIY kit after the chassis is completed.</p>

<img class="center" src="assets/base.png" style="width:650px;height:425px;margin-top:-200px>"
           <br><br><br><p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> After the parameters were set, the design of the box began with creating a two-point rectangle and setting the dimensions height(length) and width. Then the finger joints (3 small rectangles) were drawn onto the short side of the rectangle, all connected by a line. <br><br><br>The constraint equal tool was then used to make sure all of the lines and rectangles were of equal length. Then for the depth of the rectangles, the ply parameter was inserted to make sure they were 3mm. The lines and rectangles were then mirrored onto the other side of the shape, and this entire process was repeated for the long side of the rectangle as well. The shape was extruded up 3mm and this completed the design of the base. </p>

            <img class="center" src="assets/wall mirror.png" style="width:650px;height:425px;margin-top:-200px>"
           <br><p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> For the walls of the chassis, the same process was used by creating a new component and drawing a sketch on the edge of the base. On the rectangles, the shape was extruded using (-ply) so the walls would align properly over the base of the chassis. The long side wall was mirrored first over the origin plane to create an identical copy of the wall on the other side.<br><br>The short side followed suit and the only difference was the corners of the shape were projected into allow the walls to fit together properly and extruded (-ply). The short wall was mirrored over the origin and this completes the design process of the box.

           <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif">For the first box, we werenâ€™t concerned with how it looked aesthetically, we just wanted to ensure proper fitment over the DIY kit. Once we finalized the design, we made sketches of 3 of the faces (bottom, long side, and short side) and extruded those sketches into Lightburn to prepare for laser cutting. The long and short sides were copied and pasted in Lightburn, leaving a total of 5 individual pieces. After rearranging the layout of the pieces, the file was exported out of LightBurn onto a USB as a .lbrn2. </p>

         <br>  <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif">The file was plugged into the computer that does the laser cutting, and after going over the proper safety regulations, the cutting process began. </p>

         <br><p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif">The first cut fit over the car well in terms of the base, the only issue was the height of the walls was too long so we had to go back into the user parameters to make necessary adjustments. We changed the height parameter to 70mm to allow for a better fit. Also using the hole function we cut out a wheel well for the back tire.  </p>

       <br> <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left: 50px;font-family:serif">For the second box, we backtracked into fusion so that we could make some adjustments. We started by changing the user parameters for the height from 120mm to 70mm. This change brought down the size of the walls so that they would properly fit over the car. Another change we made was to add a hole in the roof of the box so that the batteries would be accessible. To do this, we utilized the hole tool to drill through the walls of the box and set the diameter to 29 mm, which was just wider than the well. A crucial part to this step was measuring the small part of the PCB just before the wheel well.</p>

                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left: 50px;font-family:serif">In terms of optimization for the model, I think that we could make the dimension a bit tighter to the kit itself. Also, I think we could add more joints to each wall of the chassis to add some strength to the design. To do this, we would have to go back and add more rectangles to each sketch, and then extrude those using the user parameters. Other than those two things, I feel like this part of the project went very well. One major thing I took away from this process was to always ensure to save your work after every change in Fusion. What happened was I almost finished the design but Fusion crashed and I lost it all as I didnâ€™t save. Although, I was a bit upset at this, I took it as a learning experience as the first design process helped assist me in making the new version even better.</p>

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> I began the process of developing my remix 3D model by brainstorming ideas for the two 3D models I wanted to research. I knew structural integrity would be very important for this project, so I decided to remix two Lego models. 

                   </p> 
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> The next step I took after finding the two models, was sketching the idea I had for what I wanted my final print to look like. This step was crucial in terms of feasibility because drawing out the model helped me visualize and revise my idea into something that would be realistic to design into a CAD model. 
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif">After sketching my design I then shifted my design into TinkerCAD by importing the stl files. TinkerCAD is an online design software that enables users to develop designs digitally that can be 3D printed. I liked that TinkerCAD was extremely user-friendly as a beginner to CAD. It made the process of creating my design straightforward as things did not get too complicated. </p>  
                  <br> <br> <br> 

                  <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> One difficulty I faced in TinkerCAD was trying to align all of the 3D model pieces. I had to import the files for each specific body part and with the limited zoom ability of TinkerCAD it led to some difficulty once I exported the STL into the Prusa slicer. 
        </p>  
            <br> <br> 

                <p style="font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> 
                In the slicing software, there were visible gaps in the design so I had to go back into TinkerCAD to re-edit the design to ensure there would be no issues when it came time to print. I also took note that the details on the models weren’t the highest resolution but that could also STEM from tinkerCAD being a beginner software. </p>
                    <br> <br> 
                    <p style="font-size:30px;font-family:serif">Once I completed the modeling in TinkerCAD I imported the .stl file in Prusa slicer. Once in the slicer I had to scale the model down as it was a bit too large so I scaled the size down to 70% of the original. 

                     </p>
                        <br> <br> 
                     <p style="font-size:27px;font-family:serif">An important note is that when I first attempted to print my design I forgot to think about the layer system of printing which caused the first print to fail. The reason for failure was that the base of the model didn’t have support as the legs were hollow resulting in them being uprooted from the base of the printer.
                      </p>
                      <br> <br> 
                      <p style="font-size:27px;font-family:serif">Also, the hands of the figure were floating which created another issue. To resolve these design flaws I added 3 raft layers to the bottom of the design in the support material tab. I also utilized the paint-on-supports tool to provide support for the hands as they printed.

                       </p>

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif;">For the printing setting, I chose a .20mm speed because in terms of detailing this speed serves as a very good middle ground. It is more optimal than the .20mm structural option because that would take days to complete the print. The speed option offers great speed for the prints whilst being deliberate in the detailing of the model. Also, structurally the number in front of the mm represents the thickness of each layer, and .20 allows for thick layers of the print providing structural integrity for the print. 
</p>  
                     <br> 
                       <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">Shifting focus to the filament I used generic PLA for both of the prints. One major benefit of PLA is it provides highly accurate dimensions during the printing process. This is important because improper dimensions can lead to a warped print with various overhangs. Another advantage of PLA is it is very easy to print as it has a low printing temperature compared to other filaments paired with a wide variety of color options making it great for beginners like myself. 
</p> 

                         <br> <br>  
                            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">I used supports for the enforcers only which is very key in terms of finalization of the print. This setting pairs with the paint-on support tool, and it will only add support to the areas highlighted in blue as shown above. This not only helps the print to be structurally sound but makes removing the excess filament after the print much easier. </p>
                              <br> <br> <br> 
                                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">Finally, for the print settings, I used an infill of 15%. This percentage determines how much of the internal volume of the print will be filled with the PLA filament. 15% is a great percentage as it allows the print to remain light and simultaneously provide strength for the print.</p>

I plugged in the USB into the Prusa Mini + printer. The initial print was a fail due to two factors. The first of those was the rafting on the bottom was not wide enough to connect to the supports that were added onto the hands. The second issue was the supports themselves did not have enough surface area on the base of the printer causing them to disconnect resulting in the failed print. </p>

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> Moreover, after revising my design in Prusa Slicer I then discovered that the shoulders were also floating. A defined problem in this print is the first layer of the print not having a firm connection to the base of the printer. The lack of adhesion caused major problems for the print as it resulted in the nozzle outputting filament onto the base of the printer as it had nothing to build upon. To resolve this issue, the surface area must be increased, and to do this, Prusa Slicer has a raft function under the support settings menu. Essentially, the rafts are a support material that goes under the print to provide a stable base. I fixed all of these errors by expanding the raft to 15mm and then adding supports to the underside of the shoulders with the paint on supports tool. This tool provided me with a precise placement for where I wanted the supports to be, rather than just anywhere on the print, assisting majorly in a successful print by way of adding an extra layer of reinforcement. </p>

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> I then ran the prints again and they both turned out to be successful as the model was now fully supported so that it could print properly. Comparatively the fusion model turned out a bit smoother than the tinker model which was a bit rough around the edges. Overall though the two prints came out to be very similar. </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5"style="margin-right: -850px;">Review</h2> 
                    <p style= "font-size:35px;font-family:serif;margin-right: -850px"> (Goals)</p>
                        <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> I completed my goal for the project of successfully remixing two different 3D models. My reasoning for choosing the two Lego designs is that I know in the real world, the blocks are universal, so I wanted to test the limitations of the printer to see if that could be matched. This process was by no means linear as my print failed multiple times prior to the successful print. However, through each failure, I was learning more about the software as I was able to utilize its tools to make the needed corrections. All in all, I would say this section of the project was an accomplishment in the right direction. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p style= "font-size:35px;font-family:serif;margin-right: -850px"> (Optimization)</p>
                        <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">In terms of design optimization, one alteration that I would make is to ensure that the raft layers are strong enough to support the print. Increasing the number of raft layers ensures my print has a stable base to develop from. Also, I would close the feet of the Lego figure to allow for more surface contact with the base of the printer. The printed model had minimal contact with the base as the feet were hollow. 
</p>
                <br><br>
                <p style= "font-size:35px;font-family:serif;margin-right: -850px"> (Future Improvement)</p>
                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">In the future, I would add more support enforcers to the lower back of the model. This is because the printer had some trouble connecting the lower abdomen to the legs. By adding support in this area it would provide a smoother print in the future. I would also go back into the CAD design tools to try and smooth out some areas of the body such as the front of the face, the hands, and the feet. I would do this by adding fillets to these sharp areas so that I could output a more optimal geometry for the model. </p>

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> To start my fusion model I decided to use the same remix as I did for the Tinker CAD model. I exported the skeleton remix .3mf file into Fusion. One thing I immediately noticed was that the user interface was much more complicated than TikerCAD. Also, there was much finer detail on the 3D model compared to TinkerCAD. I didn’t have too much editing for the model itself as I wanted to do the same remix so all I had to do was ensure there were no gaps in the model as it was a different software.

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> I decided to test an alternative model with a hole through the chest in Fusion to familiarise myself with the software. I started using the construct function to make a plane through three points. I then sketched a hole in the chest using the create function and used the extrude function to adjust the length of the cylinder. I lastly used the combine command to cut the cylinder out of the Lego body. </p> 

                <br><br><br><br>

            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> I ran into an issue with the combine command not successfully cutting the cylinder out, but this process was very informative. I learned how to use a lot of the functions with fusion, and I was very impressed with how in-depth you can go with your designs. I think although it has a larger learning curve than TinkerCAD with some practice I would prefer using fusion in terms of design customization. </p>

            <br><br><br>
           <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> After completing model editing in Fusion I exported the .stl file into Prusa Slicer once again. I had to scale down the print to save time on the print itself. I once again used the paint-on supports tool and conducted the same process as I did for the Tinker stl to provide the model with proper support when printing. </p>

I managed to do this through my alteration process of the design which gave me great insight into the tools fusion has to offer. I learned about mesh vs solid files, and how each tab has tools that tailor to various customization needs. I am only scratching the surface in terms of progress with Fusion and look forward to actionable working towards mastery in the future. </p>

                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left: 50px;font-family:serif">One optimization aspect for the model, specifically in fusion, would be to smooth the model as a hole by utilizing the mesh section- (modify>smooth). This change would help the print to come out much cleaner and with fewer overhangs around various portions as I could smooth the faces and body parts I wish to alter based on the prior print. Another optimization for this design would be to use efficient textures on the model. I would do this by importing textures from substance painter and applying that render into fusion to allow for a higher quality print. </p>

                    <p style= "font-size:35px;font-family:serif;margin-right: 5px"> (Future Improvement)</p>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left:50px;font-family:serif"> One design element I would change in the future is the proportions of the model. I would look on Lego.com to get the dimensions of the actual minifigures and match my model to those specifications. More accurate dimensions would allow for a more realistic-looking print. Another design element I would change is to change the color of the model in order to add contrast. By incorporating color contrast in the model it would also help it to look more realistic and also emphasize the details of the model itself. </p>

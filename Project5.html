This source is helpful for us in terms of narrowing down the brainstorming process for our clamp design. Specification in terms of compatibility is very important in the design process and creating a desk extension that fits the needs of our consumers is crucial to the success of the design. It also goes over the pros and cons of various clamps for desk extensions so it gives us the framework to develop a product that balances ease of use along with durability.

“Desk Clamps and the best option for you” https://atdec.com/know-how/best-clamp-for-you?srsltid=AfmBOopLd2_0-opxdL6Atkm3cCm--n7fipcYSl_fw2u-VoWukHymLjnr. This article is a great resource for our project as it goes over the most commonly used monitor arms specifically for desks. This information is key to aiding in the development of the strength of the design. The article goes into detail about the specific weight capacity for each clamp which is very important information to know so that we can determine the load that our desk extender will be capable of handling. Although this article is about monitor arms, the same sort of idea can be applied to our design in the sense that our extender will be braced by the clamp itself.

Leon, Reed “Desk Extensions – The 16 best products compared” September 22, 2023. https://textspace.net/product-guide/desks-tables/desk-extensions/. The final source provides a comparison of 16 desk extension products based on various factors that are most important to consumers in terms of usability such as (ergonomics, storage, flexibility, and stability). This can help us significantly as it acts as a resource for us to pull from the best features from some of the listed products. This will help us improve our product by taking the strengths from separate products and then combining them into one. Also, by having all the links to these products accessible to us on the website we will be able to review what the consumers have said about the products and take away what they liked about the designs.

<p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> Identify and recruit your interviewees.
○ 1. Please briefly describe yourself, such as your major, grade level, and which classrooms you regularly attend?<br><br>
F. Applied Mathematics & La Ciencia Computadora (Computer Science). Junior. Goldsmith & Golden Judaica. Pronouns: He/him<br><br>
C: I’m a fourth-year Business major who splits time between the lecture halls and the campus library. My classes often involve lectures, projects, and note-heavy lectures, so I’m constantly juggling a laptop, notebooks, a coffee cup, and textbooks.<br><br>
A, first-year student at Brandeis from Toronto, Canada. I am studying business and applied mathematics. I regularly attend the engineering classroom, my business class which is located in the International Business School, my theatre class which is located in the Spingold theatre, and my finance classroom located in G-Zang.<br><br>
N:I am a current freshman pursuing a major in Biochemistry and am currently enrolled in chemistry and biology classes. The desks I use in these classes vary a lot. In my large lecture halls I have a long table that is used by everyone in many rows going up. In smaller classrooms I have my desk connected to my chair.<br><br>
○ Can you describe specifically the desks you usually use in these classrooms? (e.g., size of desk, degree of desk tilt, stability, etc.)<br><br>
○ They're a small wooden table that folds into the side of a chair and look like an IKEA failure. These tables are fairly stable in the wobble department, though but still not a good little wood desk.<br><br>
○ Most classroom desks here are narrow, rectangular surfaces attached to chairs—maybe 18”x24” at best. They tilt slightly downward (maybe 5-10 degrees?), which is fine for writing but terrible for laptops. They wobble if you lean on them, and the edges dig into your forearms.<br><br>
○ ENGR classroom: Huge desks where multiple people can work. The desks are flat. These desks have wheels below them, which makes it easier to move and transport. Business class: Very long desks. Not much space front and back but very wide. They are flat and very stable. Unlike the engineering classroom desks, they do not move. Theatre: No desks.<br><br>
○ Finance: Super small desks. Never really understood why, as it is super inconvenient to do work. The desks vary in tilt, some are tilt right, tilt left, forward or backward. The desks are not very stable. <br><br> 

2. experience with the table <br><br>
○ During a recent class in one of these classrooms, did you experience a problem with tables that were too small or tilted? Can you tell us specifically about the situation?<br><br>
○ You asked me if I've ever had trouble with desks that are too small or tilted. All I have to say is that They are always muy poco and can't fit a computer at all. I don't even have a place to rest my mouse, so I have to live in humiliation on my trackpad. It's like playing Tetris every time I go to class, cramming my laptop, pen, textbook, and iPad together.<br><br> ○ The tilt made my laptop slide, so I had to grip it with one hand while taking notes. When I reached for my coffee, my elbow knocked the textbook off the desk. Coffee nearly spilled on my keyboard. I missed half the professor’s algorithm explanation because I was rearranging my stuff.
○ Yes. In my finance classroom, I had a lot of problems with the length and the tilt. I could barely fit my notebook on the desk to take notes. Furthermore, my pencil kept rolling off the table because of the tilt making it super annoying.<br><br>
○ I have an issue with space with my desks. If I have a desk space issue I try to adjust my position so I can fit my computer and my notebook on the table. For example in my UWS class in lown 201, the desks are quite small, only permitting me to use my computer. This makes it difficult for me to have a notebook out. I adjust by putting the notebook on my thigh or wedged between the desk and chair. This affects my learning by making it worse.<br><br>
○ How do you typically adjust your learning style or behavior when there is not enough desktop space or when the tilt is significant? How does this adjustment affect your learning outcomes?<br><br>
○ I will use my ipad or I will just touch fish.<br><br>
○ I’ve started putting my backpack on the floor to free up desk space, but then I’m constantly bending down to grab pens or tools. If the tilt’s bad, I wedge a notebook under my laptop—but then I lose writing space. These constant micro-adjustments fracture my focus. I’ve noticed my notes get spottier in classes with worse desks.<br><br>
○ I usually try to use a second desk beside me if there isn’t another classmate beside me. If that is not possible, I usually just use my laptop, since I can follow the presentation as well as take notes at the same time.<br><br>
○ 3. Deep-Rooted Causes<br><br>
○ Why do you think the school didn't address this issue in a timely manner?
Because no dinero(money).<br><br>
○ The school likely prioritizes seating capacity over ergonomics. Those tiny desks let them cram more students into rooms built 20 years ago when laptops weren’t ubiquitous. There’s also no clear channel to report “small” infrastructure issues like this—unless a desk breaks entirely, maintenance ignores it.
○ The school may not have addressed the issue of small desks due to budget constraints, as replacing furniture can be costly. Additionally, if students and teachers haven’t consistently voiced complaints, the administration may not see it as a priority. Bureaucratic processes and competing needs, such as technology upgrades or facility maintenance, could also delay action.
○ I think it's a money issue, if it's good enough it does not need to be changed for a while. It's expensive to keep changing things.

○ 4. Emotions and Feelings<br><br>
○ Are you emotionally affected when you have problems with lack of desk space or tilting in the classroom, and do these emotions have a potential impact on your learning？<br><br>
○ You think I'm going to get emotional about this? No, no, no--it's just a stupid desk. I don't study at these desks at all. After all, it's just a formality to symbolize that I've been in the classroom, and then I “bow out” of the classroom on a spiritual level. I'm out.<br><br>
○ Absolutely. It’s aggravating to fight your workspace mid-lecture. I feel distracted and self-conscious when I’m the one rustling around. Over time, it builds this low-grade resentment—like the environment isn’t designed for how we actually learn now.<br><br>
○ Yes, when I don’t have enough desk space or my desk tilts, it can be really frustrating and distracting. It makes it harder to stay organized, and I often find myself feeling irritated or stressed. This definitely affects my focus, and over time, it can make it more difficult to stay engaged and absorb information effectively.<br><br>
○ I am not emotionally affected when I have problems with my desk, I think my focus would improve if i had a better desk.<br><br>
○ How do you think performance or focus in the classroom would change if the desk was able to meet your learning needs?<br><br>
○ Seriously, though, I'd be willing to take notes on a stable, non-shaking, non-creaking desk. I don't have to worry about the “time to wake up” warning sound when I touch the desk, and I don't have to worry about disturbing my classmates who are studying hard in front of me and behind me. This kind of “silent” comfort is actually quite important.<br><br>
○ If my desk met my learning needs, I think my performance and focus in the classroom would improve significantly. With enough space to organize my materials comfortably, I wouldn’t have to constantly adjust or worry about things falling off. A stable and properly sized desk would also reduce distractions, allowing me to concentrate better and stay engaged in lessons. Overall, a better desk setup would create a more comfortable and productive learning environment.<br><br>

○ If you could adapt the desk to make certain changes, what aspects of the desk would you like to see change?<br><br>
If I could design this desk, I'd like it to have a hidden cover that slides up and down so I could hide my cell phone. That way the teacher wouldn't find out I'm touching fish - a revolutionary design for the benefit of academic fishers in general.
○ Flat, larger surfaces (min 24”x36”) to hold a laptop + notebook + beverage without precarious stacking. Adjustable tilt with a locking mechanism for writing vs. screen work. Sturdy materials—no wobble, rounded edges. Maybe add a groove for pens or a phone slot. Modular add-ons like slide-out keyboard trays or cup holders.<br><br>
○ If I could adapt the desk, I would make it larger to provide more space for books, a laptop, and writing materials. I’d also want it to be more stable, so it doesn’t tilt or wobble. Adding adjustable height options would make it more comfortable for different seating preferences, and having built-in storage or compartments could help keep things organized. A slight ergonomic tilt for writing and a smooth, durable surface would also make a big difference in improving usability.<br><br>
○ Can you recall a time when the minimal size of the desks hindered your ability to properly learn in class?<br><br>
○ At one point, I needed to jot down some notes, so I turned on my computer - but that desk only allowed me to put down half of my computer, with the other half dangling out of the desk like a classic Titanic scene.<br><br>
○ During a midterm essay in a literature elective, the tiny desk forced me to write with my paper half-hanging off the edge. My handwriting turned illegible, and the TA deducted points for “lack of clarity.”<br><br>
○ Yes, during an exam, the small desk made it hard to manage my papers and calculator. I kept rearranging everything, which was distracting and stressful, making it harder to focus and do my best.<br><br>
○ 6. Other additions<br><br>
○ Do you think the school or other students have noticed the problem? Have you communicated with each other about this issue?<br><br>
○ Everybody should be noticing the problem–those who don't are probably spies. We’ve communicated extensively regarding this issue.<br><br>
○ I think some students have noticed the problem, but it hasn’t been widely discussed. A few classmates have mentioned the desks being too small or uncomfortable, but I’m not sure if anyone has formally raised the issue with the school. It seems like something everyone just puts up with rather than actively trying to change.<br><br>
○ I would increase the size of my desk so I have more space.<br><br>

○ Have you yourself or other students tried any methods to solve this problem? How effective were they?<br><br>
○ It's simple - give up on therapy. We choose to ignore the desk, give up studying in the classroom, and take our studying to the library, dorm, or any decent desk. This method is very effective and has almost zero side effects.<br><br>
○ Some students complain about the desk but there’s no organized push. I’ve seen students squat on the floor with laptops—it is not comfortable to sit on the ground.<br><br>
○ No, neither I nor other students have tried any methods to solve the problem. It seems like everyone just adapts to the situation without attempting to find a solution.<br><br>
○  I do not think it's a big enough problem for people to be noticing or communicating about it, I have not tried any methods<br><br>

      <h3 class="mb-5"style="margin-right: -850px;">Pitches and feedback</h3> 

    <h2 class="mb-5">  Feedback:
<p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○How much force can it take?
For gzang 123 so if multiple people have the attachment how will you manage space? Students can move the chair far away from each other. The clamp goes in front of the desk so you will still be able to use the desk.<br>
<br><br>○What type of material will you be using for your prototype? The final will be metal but the original one will be #d printed
<br><br>○For a prototype will you make a smaller prototype and then scale it up to the size of the desk? We calculate how much weight the material can hold. 
<br><br>○ How heavy will the metal desk be and how will you carry it around? You can use aluminum a lightweight metal, but have to figure out what will work best. 
Possibly use a composite to allow for more strength of the desk. We need to try a lot of different things to be open to that process which will be very helpful.
<br><br>○Now the big questions are to learn from the prototype, but a clear research roadmap. 
People will have to carry it with them, but what are other options for that? One example is to permanently install them with the desks. 
<br><br>○Could also possibly store them in the classroom. 
In the drawings, they look desk-like, and a lot of the desk holders don't look desk-like but instead open up and create space. 
<br><br>

2. In-class testing
Feedback from other group
It will be useful to add cup holders(similar to airplanes)
Design the desk to be larger than the computer
If the weight is not as light as expected(not easy to carry) we can design a bag, (like a computer bag)

Analyze
</h2>
<br><br> 
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ Takeaways: After attempting to print out the pins, screws, and clamp for our desk extension we ran into some problems. We realized that printing the parts would not be the best idea as the printer nozzle is .40mm so the fine details of the print did not come out as well as expected. So we now know it will be much easier to source these parts as it will make for an end product with much better strength and durability. <br><br> 
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ What do users like: One thing users really liked about the design was that it was foldable. This idea of being able to take the desk extension with you anywhere you go was very well received. Another thing that was liked was the desk extension would rid clutter for the users, allowing them to be better organized in class. Finally, the increased workspace was one of the major likes amongst the interviewees as the current desks are very small and do not allow for many items to be put on the desk. The extension would increase surface area and allow the users to put whatever they need for class on the desk with a comfortable amount of desk room.<br><br> 
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ What they criticize and want to change: They would like to see the desk extension to be larger than the computer. This is because they didn’t want the computer to take up all of the extra desk space so increasing the surface area would allow them to put down other items. Interviewees also wanted to see the aspect of cupholders added to the desk extension. This is due to the fact that a lot of the time students will have to put their cups on the ground as there is no extra desk space to put their drinks. Another criticism was to have the desk extenders be stored inside of the classroom. By doing this it will allow students to simply go to class and set up the desk extenders there rather than having to carry them around all the time. <br><br> 

 <h2 class="mb-5">
Prioritize
</h2>
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ 1. Inclusive accessibility: The desk extension must prioritize universal accessibility, ensuring it adapts to diverse users and environments. Feedback highlights the need to support students with disabilities (e.g., wheelchair compatibility) and minimize classroom disruption. For instance, the clamp design must accommodate varying desk and chair sizes without obstructing movement. Criticisms about space management (e.g., “how would you manage space if multiple people use it?”) reinforce the importance of adaptability. Additionally, we must ensure the design does not become a distraction, maintaining a balance between functionality and classroom integration. This principle aligns with user aspirations for independence, safety, and inclusion. Key Takeaways: 1. Optimize clamp mechanisms for wheelchairs and uneven surfaces. 2.Ensure minimal spatial footprint to avoid crowding. 3. Prioritize discrete integration to prevent distractions. <br><br> 
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ 2. Lightweight Portability with Structural Durability: The desk must reconcile portability(easy to carry) with strong structural integrity. Feedback repeatedly criticized the prototype’s weight and raised questions about material strength (“How much force will it withstand?”). Proposed solutions include using lightweight metals like aluminum or composites, designing a dedicated carrying bag, or storing extensions in classrooms. We must also address force resistance through iterative prototyping—testing materials like 3D-printed plastics for initial models and metals for final versions. Key Takeaways: 1. Use aluminum or composites to reduce weight while maintaining strength. 2. Provide multiple carrying/storage options (e.g., bags, classroom storage). 3. Conduct stress tests to determine load thresholds during prototyping.<br><br> 
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ 3.User-centered functional design: Feedback emphasizes practical features that enhance usability and comfort. Users requested functional additions like cup holders, heat-dissipating holes, and workspace optimization (“larger than the computer”). These details directly impact daily usability and align with partner principles of efficiency and comfort. We must also ensure the desk’s size and shape accommodate laptops and accessories without compromising portability. For example, heat vents prevent device overheating, while cup holders mimic airplane tray utility. Key Takeaways: Integrate modular features(cup holders, heat vents) based on user requests. 2. Design workspace dimensions to exceed standard laptop sizes. 3. Balance functionality with foldability to retain compactness.<br><br> 
 <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">○ 4. Cost-effective Scalability: We also need to commit to affordability and scalable production. Concerns about cost (“How will it be affordable for all students?”) necessitate material and process optimization. For instance, using 3D printing for prototypes reduces initial costs, while bulk manufacturing with aluminum could lower final product prices. Additionally, iterative prototyping (“test different materials to be open to that process”) ensures cost-effective solutions emerge early. Storing extensions in classrooms instead of individual ownership further reduces financial barriers. Key Takeaways: 1. Prioritize cost-efficient materials(composites over pure metals). 2. Explore institutional solutions like classroom storage to minimize individual cost 3. Use scalable prototyping methods(3D printing) to refine designs before mass production(this is a future consideration)<br><br>

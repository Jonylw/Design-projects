                   <p style= "font-size:30px;"> To begin the process of developing the 3D printed name tag I downloaded the software for the Prusa slicer and imported the 3MF file for the name tag. I found this initial step to be a bit tricky as the software was still new to me, so once I got the file into the software I spent some time initially working to figure out how to adjust the model itself.
                   </p> 
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;"> I corrected the printing settings to make sure the speed was set to 0.20mm, the filament was set to generic PLA, and the printer itself set to Original Prusa MINI & MINI+ Input shaper. I learned that having the settings selected to the incorrect material can cause the nozzle on the 3D printer to jam. </p>
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;">After the setting corrections, I then sliced the 3D model which allowed me to modify the printing specifications even further. In example, the slider on the left side allowed me to adjust which layer of the print I am viewing from top to bottom.</p>

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;">As for the slicing components, the nametag primarily consisted of 32.5 solid infill. This was followed by, 16.9% external perimeter, 9.5% bridge infill, 8.9% perimeter, 7.5% top solid infill, 1.2% custom, and 1.1% internal infill. The slider allows the user to visualize the specific amount of material that will be added, and at what time of the printing process it will appear.</p>  
                     <br> <br> <br> 
                       <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;">I then began the process of completing the job number request form. This form is important especially for longer prints because the code given at the end of the form is the only way prints can be associated with individuals, especially if they are left overnight. In order to fill out the form I utilized the sliced info from the Prusa Slicer software. This information included the location, filament type(PLA), amount of filament: 3.96g, printer type: Prusa Mini+, and lastly the 3mf file for the print.</p> 

                         <br> <br> <br> 
                            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;">At this point I was ready to print my nametag, but before I did I used the Prusa Software once more to export the G-code onto the USB plug in. The USB essentially serves as the instructions for the printer to print your 3D model. I drug and dropped the file into the USB drive and then ejected it before taking out the USB.</p>

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;"> An issue in this print was the gaps in the thin walls of the nametag text. This issue resulted in the letters being very thin and fragile. A solution to this problem in Prusa Slicer would be to utilize the gap fill function, which fills the spaces between the walls of the print. This fix would allow for more legible text and a more even print. </p>

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;"> For my second print it consisted of a “torture test” on the printers which is a 3D print meant to push the physical capabilities of the 3D printer. </p>

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;"> I began by downloading the torture test file as an STL, comparatively to the first file download which was a 3MF. 3MF files are XML-based meaning they are capable of storing various types of data such as textures, color, and material. STL files are restricted in the sense of only being able to encode for geometric surfaces.

            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;"> Subsequent to downloading the file I once again sliced the file and uploaded the G-code onto the USB. One thing I took note of while in Prusa slice is the sheer amount of time it take to print said torture test as the geometric shapes required of the printer are very challenging. I also got a stability warning after I sliced the file which is a warning that lets the user know the print has a high probability of being unsuccessful.

         <div class="content-section-heading text-center">                
        <h2 class="mb-5">Print Quality</h2>
        <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left: 50px;"> The resolution of the print itself came out quite good as the shapes are all clearly defined. Although, there were two caveats, the snowflake and the text. The snowflake  did not come out at all on the print itself as the design was too intricate. The text did end up printing, but a lot of the letters and numbers aren’t very legible. This tells me that the printer struggles with finite details as well as highly intricate shapes. 

        <h2 class="mb-5">Quality Resolution</h2>
        <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left: 50px;">

            The major issue with the print quality came from the smaller features not being printed. This problem occurs when the dimensions of the feature are smaller than the nozzle itself. To fix this issue in the advanced settings of Prusa Slicer, there is a feature called single extrusion wall. This feature enables the slicing software to print walls with the thickness of one extrusion width. In turn, this would allow for a successful print that demands higher quality detailing such as the torture test print. 
            <br> <br> <br>
            <h2 class="mb-5">Accuracy and Durability</h2>
                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left: 50px;"> Overall the print itself matches quite well to the 3D model that was crafted on Prusa slicer. The printer did a very good job sectioning the shapes off ensuring that they did not come into contact with one another. There was minimal distortion all in all, and structurally the print feels very secure. There was no breakage on the print either which is also a good sign of structural integrity. 
                    <br> <br> <br>
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Limitations</h2>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;margin-left:50px"> The printer definitely does have some geometric limitations especially when it comes to intricate shapes such as the snowflake. This is caused by the layer-by-layer printing process which visually can be seen in prusa slicer. Due to this process it can cause overhangs within the 3D print which are part of the print that lack support beneath them.

                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> For my fourth project we were tasked with 3D printing a prosthetic hand, and once printed put together the pieces following a manual. The first step of the process was registration on the e-NABLE hub to download the stl file for the Phoenix Hand V2. 

                   </p> 
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> Navigation of the e-NABLE hubâ€™s Phoenix v2 Hand page proved to be a bit difficult as various challenges arose. For one, the discernment of the different pin sizes for the hands was very difficult to distinguish visually as they all look similar on the webpage. Another issue that presented itself was the page structure. The page itself although it had very detailed information, this made it difficult to pinpoint specific information that I was searching for. Once I finished navigating through the website I decided to use the e-NABLE page as the foundation for beginning the process of constructing the Phoenis Hand V2. 
 </p>
                    <br> <br>
                   <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> In terms of instructions, I ended up using a mix of the PDF instructions and various YouTube videos on the assembly of the hand. I found the PDF instructions to be more helpful than the youtube video as it went step by step to make assembly easier to follow along. The YouTube video: at some points would skip important steps in the assembly such as the stringing of the hand. It would start off stringing the first finger and then in the next second, the entire hand was stringing. So then I would have to refer to the pdf manual to fill in the gaps for the missing information. The YouTube video allowed a better visual example for assembly as sometimes the photos on the PDF had bad angles and made the attempt at replication difficult.   </p>  
                  <br> <br> <br> 

                  <p style= "font-size:30px;font-family:serif"> Something I would suggest for the PDF is to add more pictures at different angles to make assembly easier. Then for the YouTube video, I would slow down on the steps that are most challenging such as the stringing to allow users a better opportunity to follow along.

Part 2: 3D Printing & assembling the model
</h2>

Once the file was downloaded from e-NABLE I imported them into Prusa slicer and sorted the pieces accordingly on individual printer bases. I was then tasked with scaling the parts to 150% to allow for proper fitment once the building process was underway. This part of the process proved challenging as arranging the pieces so that they would all fit together in the minimal spaces of the Prusa MINI+ 3D base plates was not easy. To overcome this challenge I used grouping of similar parts to allow for an optimal printing process. Also, I worked with my partner to see what she was printing so that it could save us time as we would have to print fewer parts.

</p>  
                     <br> 
                     <img class="center" src="assets/Slicewraft.png" style="width:550px;height:300px;margin-bottom:50px;transform:translate(575px,0px)"/> <br><br>
                       <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">After some time of shifting the pieces around I was able to successfully arrange them on the bases of the printer. One edit that I made to the print layout prior to exporting the file was I added a raft layer on base 1 to make sure the fingers had proper stability during printing as they were smaller parts. The raft layer has various benefits such as making the removal process easier and enhancing the object adhesion to the bed of the printer. </p>

                          

                            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"></p>

This percentage determines how much of the internal volume of the print will be filled with the PLA filament. 15% is a great percentage as it allows the print to remain light and simultaneously provide strength for the print.</p>

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> For the height of the individual layers, I used .20mm. This is because it allows for a great balance between print quality and print time. By adjusting the height of the layers those two factors change co-dependently. In this relationship increasing the layer height, decreases the print time as there are fewer layers that need to be printed. However, by doing so this causes a decrease in print quality as the individual layers are more prominent so it can result in a rougher print overall. Decreasing the layer height produces the opposite effect of the relationship listed above.

                <br> <br>
                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> As for the material selection I chose generic PLA as very easy to use as it requires a low printing temperature and is also widely available in many different colors. Also, it has good adhesion to the base minimizing the probability of print detachment during printing.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif">For the supports, I chose support on build plate only for two specific reasons. For one it allows the removal process to be much easier as the support binds underneath the model so there is no worry about damaging and scratching the print. The second reason is provides quicker print times and simplistic structural support that does not require many layers.
 </p>
            <br><br>    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> The infill was set to 35 because this model needed to be solid so a higher level of infill provides a stronger model. The infill acts essentially as the framework for the internal structure of the model, preventing weakness.

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> The prints came out very good in terms of quality as using the open-source file allowed for a print that already had optimized settings to enable a smoother assembly process. Also because open source files are available to anyone, the potential errors that could potentially arise importing your own .stl file are caught and resolved by other users. So by the time you go to print the files are highly refined as they constantly improve over time.
 </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> The assembly process was now underway and we started by first removing the individual pieces of the hand from the excess raft layer. This part of the process was very difficult as the density of the pieces themselves made it very challenging to remove them. A fix to this problem was to use pliers to get a better grip on the parts, and then by providing tension to the raft layer in one hand and pulling the piece off in the other I was able to get the parts off. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="center" src="assets/Removal process.png" style="width:550px;height:500px;margin-bottom:50px;transform:translate(575px,0px)"/> 

                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> After getting the parts off of the raft we made sure to first count all of our pieces before we began building and then arranged them all in the order of assembly. To guide us through the assembly process my partner and I utilized mainly a YouTube tutorial on how to construct the hand itself. We also referred to the manual at times when we got lost and had to retrace our steps. The most difficult part about the assembly was definitely stringing the finger as where to tie the knots was sometimes unclear. To resolve this issue I had to reference another YouTube tutorial that did one finger at a time as the first one skipped through the stringing process. I then put the video in .5x speed to see exactly how the cords were being threaded.
</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left; display: flex;width: 85vw;font-family:serif"> Overall, the assembly process was very straightforward and my partner and I took turns by one person at times working on trying to assemble white the other person referred to the instructions to act as a guide. We completed the hand at the end of this process and had full functionality. </p>

             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> The final task of this project was to draw up, and then develop an extension that provides a change for the Pheonix Hand V2. I went through a couple of ideas but decided to make a padding enhancement for the palm to improve comfort for users when wearing it. To start this process I first drew out the additional support on a piece of paper.
 </p>.     
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <img class="center" src="assets/Fusionenhance.png" style="width:450px;height:425px;margin-top:-200px>"
            <br>

             
             <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> For the design in fusion, I first imported the palm mesh left into fusion to act as my template for the padding. I then created a sketch and used the fit point spleen tool to accurately draw up a padding outline that would properly fit the hand. I then deleted the palm mesh as the sketch was complete, and extruded the sketch up 3 millimeters. Lastly, I changed the material of the padding to fabric so that the interwoven pieces of what the padding would look like showed. 
 </p> 

                <br><br><br><br>

            <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> This padding enhancement will allow for improvement in various areas in terms of functionality. The padding will increase comfort for the user as sometimes the 3D-printed material can become uncomfortable. Also, the padding will distribute the pressure across the palm more evenly making wearing the prosthetic more comfortable over longer periods of time. This improvement can be very helpful for those will sensitive skin that could easily get irritated by the friction from the printed material. The padding will also give users better control of the hand as the introduction of personalized padding that fits the user's needs could be momentous for daily use.  The increased control can allow users better support when trying to grip objects of varying shapes.

            <h2 class="mb-5">Reflection</h2>
           <p style= "font-size:30px;text-align: left;font-family:serif"> This project put on display the true power of open-source assistive technology. It really put into perspective for me just how important accessibility is in the design process. Taking into consideration all the potential challenges users may face, and then making optimizations to counteract those barriers is really important. This process truly reminded me of the Inclusive Design Spring: Team Xbox in terms of accessibility. It drew on similar ideas of approaching the project in such a way that creates solutions for the users. Another major one talked about in the Design Spring was how the design needs to be usable for a wide range of ability levels. Similarly, the hand follows suit by having various adaptions for users with different disabilities. Lastly, in terms of innovation, the constant refinery of the Pheonix hand V2 given that it is open source can allow developers from all over the world to create solutions for users based on their individual needs.
